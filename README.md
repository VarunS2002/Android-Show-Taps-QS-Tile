## Note:

- Regarding **Play Protect** warning:
  - Play Protect might show a warning before installing this app.
  - This is because this app targets Android 5.1 (Lollipop/SDK 22) which is outdated and not allowed on the Play Store.
  - The reason for this app to target SDK 22 is that apps targeting Android 6 (Marshmallow/SDK 23) and above are not allowed to modify secure system settings such as "Show Taps".
  - This app is completely safe to install and use and no data is collected either.

- This app may not work on all devices due to ROM specific issues.
